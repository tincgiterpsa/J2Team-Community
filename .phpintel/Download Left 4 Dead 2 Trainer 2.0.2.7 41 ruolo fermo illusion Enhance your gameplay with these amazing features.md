One of the advantages of playing as a zombie in Left 4 Dead 2 is that you can use your special abilities to ambush, trap, or distract the survivors. For example, as a Hunter, you can leap on a survivor and pin them down, as a Smoker, you can drag a survivor with your tongue, as a Boomer, you can vomit on a survivor and attract more zombies, and as a Spitter, you can spit acid that damages survivors and blocks their path.
 
Another advantage of playing as a zombie is that you can explore the maps and find hidden areas or shortcuts that you may not notice as a survivor. You can also learn the layout of the maps and the spawn points of the zombies and items. This can help you improve your strategy and tactics when you play as a survivor or against other players.
 
However, playing as a zombie also has some disadvantages. For one thing, you have to wait for your special ability to recharge before you can use it again. This means you have to be careful when and how you use it. For another thing, you have to deal with the AI director, which controls the flow of the game and the difficulty level. The AI director may spawn more or less zombies depending on how well or poorly you are doing. It may also change the weather, lighting, or events to make the game more unpredictable.
