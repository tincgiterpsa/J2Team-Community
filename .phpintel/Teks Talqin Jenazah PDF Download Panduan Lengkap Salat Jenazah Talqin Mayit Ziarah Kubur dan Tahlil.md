## What is the Teks Talqin Jenazah?
 
The teks talqin jenazah is a text that contains the words of the talqin, which is a reminder or instruction given to the deceased after the burial. The word talqin comes from the Arabic root word laqana, which means to teach, instruct, or make someone understand something.
 
The talqin is based on the hadith (narration) of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who said: "When one of you dies and his body is placed in his grave in his final resting place, two angels will come to him. They will make him sit up and ask him: 'Who is your Lord?' He will say: 'My Lord is Allah.' They will ask him: 'What is your religion?' He will say: 'My religion is Islam.' They will ask him: 'Who is this man who was sent among you?' He will say: 'He is the Messenger of Allah.' They will ask him: 'What did you do?' He will say: 'I read Allah's Book and I believed in it.' Then a voice will call out from heaven: 'My servant has spoken the truth, so spread a bed for him from Paradise, clothe him from Paradise, and open a door for him into Paradise.'" (Sahih Muslim)
 
The purpose of the talqin is to help the deceased remember these answers and to confirm their faith and obedience to Allah. The talqin also serves as a reminder for the living to prepare themselves for their own death and accountability.
 
## What are the Sources of the Teks Talqin Jenazah?
 
The teks talqin jenazah is derived from the Quran, the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and the consensus of the scholars of Islam. The Quran states: "O you who have believed, fear Allah as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims [in submission to Him]." (Quran 3:102)
