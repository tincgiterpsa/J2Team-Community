iZotope Ozone is a comprehensive mastering suite that offers a range of features and modules to enhance your audio quality and creativity. You can use it as a standalone application or as a plug-in in your favorite DAW. Some of the features include:
 
- Master Assistant: This feature analyzes your audio and suggests a starting point for your mastering process. You can customize it to match your reference tracks or genre targets across tone, dynamics and width[^1^].
- Stabilizer Module: This is a new module in Ozone 10 that acts as an intelligent and adaptive mastering EQ. It can dynamically shape your mix into a clear, natural tone, or tame problem resonance, carve away harshness, and smooth transients for better translation across listening environments[^1^].
- Impact Module: This is another new module in Ozone 10 that allows you to control the microdynamics of your mix. You can use it to enhance the rhythm and feel of your tracks by adding punch and dynamic space, or gluing your track together for a thicker sound[^1^].
- Magnify Soft Clip: This is a new feature in the Maximizer Module that boosts loudness while maintaining high fidelity audio. It amplifies the MaximizerÃ¢Â€Â™s IRC algorithms used on countless hit records[^1^].
- Recover Sides: This is a new feature in the Imager Module that reduces width without losing the sides. It preserves stereo information in mono so you can maintain depth and power when narrowing problem frequencies like a wide bass[^1^].
- Vinyl: This is a free plug-in that simulates the dust, scratches, warp, and mechanical noise reminiscent of yesteryear. You can add it to your tracks for some lo-fi flavor[^2^].
- Ozone Imager: This is another free plug-in that offers immersive, fluid visuals, full resizability, and a new, smoother mode for creating stereo. It gives you a wider world of possibilities for imaging in your mix[^2^].
- Vocal Doubler: This is yet another free plug-in that enhances your vocal with a natural doubling effect, adding richness and depth[^2^].
