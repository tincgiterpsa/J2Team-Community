## Billa 2 Movie Review: A Stylish but Flawed Prequel
 
Billa 2 is a movie that tries to show the origin story of David Billa, one of the most notorious gangsters in Tamil cinema. The movie is a prequel to the 2007 remake of Billa, which itself was a remake of the 1980 classic starring Rajinikanth. Billa 2 is directed by Chakri Toleti and features Ajith Kumar reprising his role as the titular character.
 
The movie starts with David Billa as a refugee from Sri Lanka, who lands in Tamil Nadu and gets involved in a diamond smuggling racket. He soon catches the eye of Abbasi, a powerful don based in Goa, who recruits him as his right-hand man. Billa proves his loyalty and efficiency by eliminating Abbasi's rivals and expanding his business to drugs and arms. However, he also faces enemies from within and without, such as Dmitri, a Russian mafia boss who wants to take over Abbasi's territory, and Ranjith, Abbasi's jealous brother-in-law who plots against Billa. Billa also falls in love with Sameera, Abbasi's girlfriend, and has to deal with Jasmine, his adopted niece who has a crush on him. How Billa rises from a nobody to a dreaded don is what the movie is all about.
 
Billa 2 is a movie that relies heavily on style and action. The cinematography, editing and stunts are top-notch and create a slick and glossy look for the movie. The locations, costumes and props are also well-chosen and add to the glamour quotient. The music by Yuvan Shankar Raja is catchy and suits the mood of the movie. The songs are well-picturized and do not hamper the pace of the movie.

However, where the movie falters is in its script and narration. The movie lacks a coherent plot and logic, and jumps from one scene to another without much connection or explanation. The characters are poorly developed and lack depth or motivation. The dialogues are clichÃ©d and repetitive, and do not convey any emotion or personality. The movie also suffers from a lack of suspense or thrill, as everything happens too easily and predictably for Billa. The movie does not explore the psychological or moral aspects of Billa's transformation, and instead glorifies his violence and ruthlessness.
 
The saving grace of the movie is Ajith Kumar's performance as Billa. He carries the movie on his shoulders with his charisma and screen presence. He looks stylish and suave in every frame, and delivers his lines with confidence and attitude. He also excels in the action sequences, especially the helicopter stunt that he performed himself without any body double. He is undoubtedly the star attraction of the movie.
 
The supporting cast does not have much to do in the movie, as they are overshadowed by Ajith's dominance. Sudhanshu Pandey as Abbasi is decent but not menacing enough as a villain. Vidyut Jammwal as Dmitri is impressive in his fight scenes but lacks characterisation. Bruna Abdullah as Sameera is beautiful but bland as Billa's love interest. Parvathy Omanakuttan as Jasmine is cute but annoying as Billa's niece. The rest of the cast is forgettable.
 
Billa 2 is a movie that will appeal to Ajith fans and action lovers, but will disappoint those who expect a gripping and engaging story. It is a stylish but flawed prequel that does not live up to the expectations set by its predecessor.
