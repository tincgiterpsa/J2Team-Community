LISREL is a software program that allows researchers to perform structural equation modeling (SEM), a statistical technique that can test complex relationships among observed and latent variables. LISREL was developed by Karl JÃƒÂ¶reskog and his colleagues in the 1970s and has become one of the most widely used SEM software in the world.

LISREL 9.1 is the latest version of the software, released in 2020 by Scientific Software International, Inc. It is a 64-bit application that can handle standard and multilevel SEM, as well as generalized linear models (GLIMs) and multilevel GLIMs. LISREL 9.1 can also handle data from simple random and complex survey designs, as well as data with missing values, categorical variables, and non-normal distributions.
 
LISREL 9.1 comes with several other applications that can help researchers with data manipulation, data transformation, data generation, moment matrix computation, imputation, multiple regression, logistic regression, censored regression, exploratory factor analysis, and more. LISREL 9.1 also has a user-friendly graphical interface that allows users to draw path diagrams, specify models, run analyses, and view results.
 
One of the advantages of LISREL 9.1 is that it offers a free trial license for 15 days after activation. This means that researchers can try out the software before purchasing it. The free trial license has no limitations in terms of features or functionality, except that it expires after 15 days.
 
LISREL 9.1 is compatible with Windows operating systems and requires a minimum of 4 GB of RAM and 500 MB of disk space. The software can be downloaded from the official website of Scientific Software International, Inc., where users can also find more information about the product, such as pricing, licensing options, examples, tutorials, and support.
 
LISREL 9.1 is a powerful software for structural equation modeling that can help researchers test complex hypotheses and discover new insights from their data. It is a comprehensive and flexible tool that can handle various types of data and models. It is also easy to use and offers a free trial license for users who want to try it out.
  
LISREL 9.1 can perform various types of SEM analyses, such as confirmatory factor analysis, path analysis, structural regression, latent growth curve modeling, latent class analysis, and more. It can also estimate different types of parameters, such as factor loadings, regression coefficients, correlations, variances, covariances, means, intercepts, slopes, and thresholds. LISREL 9.1 can test the overall fit of the model to the data, as well as the significance and confidence intervals of the parameters.
 
LISREL 9.1 can also handle complex data structures and modeling situations, such as multilevel data, longitudinal data, clustered data, nested data, cross-classified data, and hierarchical data. It can also account for the effects of sampling weights, stratification, clustering, and finite population correction factors on the estimation and inference. LISREL 9.1 can also handle data with missing values using various methods, such as full information maximum likelihood (FIML), multiple imputation (MI), and imputation by matching (IBM).
 
LISREL 9.1 can also perform GLIMs and multilevel GLIMs for data with categorical, count, or non-normally distributed outcome variables. It can fit models for the multinomial, Bernoulli, binomial, negative binomial, Poisson, normal, gamma, and inverse Gaussian sampling distributions. It can also estimate various link functions, such as logit, probit, complementary log-log, log-log, identity, log, inverse, and power.
