The factory library is divided into six categories: Electronic, Urban, Acoustic, Percussion, Cinematic and Kit Specials. Each category has a number of subcategories that further refine the style and genre of the kits. For example, Electronic has subcategories such as House, Techno, Trance, Dubstep, Glitch and more. The kits are color-coded for easy recognition and navigation. You can also use the tag-based browser to quickly find and load sounds based on attributes such as type, character, genre and mood.
 
The quality and variety of the sounds in the factory library are impressive. You can find everything from classic drum machines and acoustic drums to ethnic percussion and sound design elements. The sounds are crisp, punchy and well-balanced. The kits are also well-organized and mapped to the keyboard or pads for instant playability. You can easily tweak the sounds using the built-in effects, modulation and routing options. You can also drag and drop your own samples into the cells and assign them colors and tags.
 
One of the highlights of the factory library is the Kit Specials category, which contains some unique and creative kits that showcase the potential of Battery 4. For example, there are kits that use convolution reverb to create realistic spaces, kits that use time stretching to create glitchy effects, kits that use sidechaining to create dynamic grooves and kits that use MIDI learn to assign sounds to performance controllers. These kits are not only fun to play with, but also inspiring and educational.
 
The factory library also comes with some exclusive kits created by renowned artists such as Phon.o, Om Unit, Zombie Disco Squad and Starkey. These kits reflect their signature styles and sounds, and offer a glimpse into their production techniques. You can download these kits for free from Native Instruments' website.
