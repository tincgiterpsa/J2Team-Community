Floriculture in India has a long and rich tradition that dates back to ancient times. The Vedas, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and other classical texts mention the use of flowers for religious, ceremonial, and decorative purposes. The Mughals, the British, and other foreign influences also contributed to the development of floriculture in India. The Indian floriculture industry has grown significantly in the past few decades due to the increasing demand for flowers both in the domestic and international markets. India is one of the leading producers and exporters of flowers in the world.
 
Floriculture in India offers many benefits to the growers, consumers, and the environment. It provides employment opportunities, income generation, foreign exchange earnings, and rural development. It also enhances the beauty, health, and well-being of people by creating a pleasant and soothing atmosphere. It promotes biodiversity conservation by preserving and propagating native and endangered floral species. It also helps in reducing air pollution, soil erosion, and water scarcity by improving the ecological balance.
 
Floriculture in India also faces some challenges such as lack of infrastructure, skilled manpower, quality standards, research and development, and policy support. It also faces competition from other countries that have lower production costs, better technology, and higher quality products. It also suffers from climatic uncertainties, pest infestations, disease outbreaks, and post-harvest losses. It also needs to address the social and environmental issues such as labor exploitation, child labor, gender inequality, pesticide misuse, water wastage, and land degradation.

Floriculture in India has a bright future as the demand for flowers is expected to grow further in the coming years. The government, the private sector, and the civil society have been taking various initiatives to support and promote floriculture in India. Some of these initiatives include providing subsidies, loans, insurance, training, certification, and market linkages to the growers. They also include organizing exhibitions, fairs, festivals, and competitions to showcase and celebrate the diversity and excellence of floriculture in India. They also include creating awareness and appreciation among the public about the importance and value of floriculture.
