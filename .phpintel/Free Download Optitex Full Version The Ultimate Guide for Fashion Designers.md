One option is to use the official website of Optitex, which offers a free trial version of the software for 30 days. You can download the O/22 installation package of your choice, which includes PDS 2D/3D & Marker, 3D sample pack, 2D sample pack, Fabric Meter, and more[^1^]. However, you will need to register an account and provide some personal information to access the download link. You will also need a valid Annual Maintenance Contract to use the Optitex Asset Portal[^1^].
 
Another option is to use a third-party website that offers cracked versions of Optitex. These websites claim to provide full versions of Optitex with extra features and without any limitations. For example, Pesktop.com offers Optitex 15.0.198.0 + Extra Pack for free download[^2^]. However, these websites are not authorized by Optitex and may contain viruses, malware, or spyware that can harm your computer or steal your data. You will also be violating the terms and conditions of Optitex and may face legal consequences if you use these cracked versions.
 
A third option is to use a website that sells Optitex licenses at a discounted price. These websites claim to provide genuine and working versions of Optitex with full support and updates. For example, Embcads.com offers Optitex 21 Full Pack with 3D+Nest Multicore+Cutplan for $150[^3^] or Optitex 19.5 Full Suite for $100[^4^]. However, these websites are not affiliated with Optitex and may not deliver what they promise. You may end up paying for a fake or expired license that does not work or gets blocked by Optitex. You will also be risking your personal and financial information by using these websites.
 
Therefore, the best and safest way to download Optitex full version for free is to use the official website of Optitex and sign up for the free trial version. This way, you can test the software and its features before deciding whether to purchase it or not. You will also avoid any legal or security issues that may arise from using unauthorized or cracked versions of Optitex.

If you decide to purchase Optitex after the free trial period, you can choose from different plans and packages that suit your needs and budget.
