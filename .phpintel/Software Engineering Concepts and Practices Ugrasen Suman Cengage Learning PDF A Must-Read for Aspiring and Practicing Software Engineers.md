One of the books that aims to provide a comprehensive and practical introduction to software engineering is *Software Engineering: Concepts and Practices* by Ugrasen Suman. Published by Cengage Learning in 2019, this book covers the fundamental concepts and practices of software engineering as applicable to the software industry. It is intended for undergraduate and postgraduate students of computer science and engineering, as well as for software professionals who want to update their knowledge and skills.
 
The book consists of 16 chapters that are organized into six units. The first unit introduces the nature, scope, and challenges of software engineering, as well as the generic and specialized process models that guide software development. The second unit focuses on the requirements analysis and specification phase, where the software problem is defined and documented. The third unit covers the software design phase, where the software solution is conceptualized and structured using various techniques and models. The fourth unit deals with the coding and testing phase, where the software is implemented and verified for correctness and quality. The fifth unit discusses the software reliability and quality management aspects, such as statistical testing, quality standards, and process improvement models. The sixth unit explores the software maintenance and reuse issues, such as configuration management, maintenance models, and reuse approaches.
 
The book is written in a clear and concise manner, with illustrative examples, case studies, exercises, and multiple choice questions to enhance the learning experience. The book also provides references to relevant literature and online resources for further reading. The book is suitable for both classroom teaching and self-study.
 
*Software Engineering: Concepts and Practices* by Ugrasen Suman is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn or improve their software engineering skills. It provides a comprehensive overview of the theory and practice of software engineering, with an emphasis on the current trends and challenges in the software industry.

The book is divided into two parts: Part I covers the basic concepts and principles of software engineering, while Part II covers the advanced topics and applications of software engineering. Each chapter in Part I begins with a list of learning objectives, followed by an introduction, a main body, a summary, and a set of review questions. Each chapter in Part II begins with a brief overview, followed by a detailed discussion of the topic, and ends with a set of references and further reading suggestions. The book also includes two appendices: Appendix A provides a glossary of software engineering terms, and Appendix B provides a list of software engineering tools and websites.
 
The book covers a wide range of topics and issues related to software engineering, such as:
 
- The evolution and characteristics of software and software engineering
- The software life cycle models and their advantages and disadvantages
- The software requirements engineering process and techniques
- The software design principles and methods, such as structured analysis and design, object-oriented analysis and design, component-based design, and user interface design
- The software coding standards and guidelines
- The software testing strategies and techniques, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and debugging
- The software reliability models and metrics
- The software quality assurance methods and standards, such as ISO 9000 and CMMI
- The software project management activities and techniques, such as planning, estimation, scheduling, risk management, and team management
