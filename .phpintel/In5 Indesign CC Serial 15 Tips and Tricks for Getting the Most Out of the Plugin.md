In this article, we'll show you how to use in5 to create an interactive web banner with animations and buttons. You'll need InDesign CC 2015 or later and a serial number for in5 version 15 or later. You can download a free trial of in5 from [here](https://ajarproductions.com/pages/products/in5/download.php) [^1^].
 
## Step 1: Create your InDesign document
 
Open InDesign and create a new document with the dimensions of your web banner. For this example, we'll use 300 x 250 pixels. Add some text and images to your document as you normally would. You can also use InDesign's native interactive features, such as buttons, animations, hyperlinks, and video, to add more functionality to your banner. In5 will preserve these features when exporting your document.
 
## Step 2: Export your document with in5
 
Once you're happy with your design, go to File > Export HTML5 with in5... This will open the in5 dialog box where you can choose your export options. For this example, we'll use the Web Banner preset, which will optimize your output for web display and performance. You can also customize the settings to suit your needs.
 
Enter your serial number for in5 in the License tab and click OK. Choose a location to save your output files and click Save. In5 will export your document as a folder containing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files.
 
## Step 3: Preview and publish your web banner
 
To preview your web banner, open the index.html file in your browser. You should see your InDesign document as an interactive web banner that works on any device. You can also test it on different browsers and screen sizes to make sure it looks good.
 
To publish your web banner, you need to upload the output folder to a web server or a hosting service. You can then embed the web banner on your website using an iframe tag or a script tag.
