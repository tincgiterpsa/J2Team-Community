## Step 1: Locate the BmEngine.ini file
 
The first step is to find the BmEngine.ini file in your game folder. This file contains the configuration settings for the game engine, including the language option. To find this file, you need to open your Documents folder or navigate to C:\Users\\*Your Username\*\Documents. Note that if your Windows installation is on a different drive letter, you will need to use that instead.
 
Once you are in your Documents folder, go to Square Enix > Batman Arkham Asylum GOTY > BmGame > Config. Inside this folder, you should see the BmEngine.ini file. Right-click on it and choose Open with > Notepad or any other text editor.
 
## Step 2: Edit the Language option
 
The next step is to edit the Language option in the BmEngine.ini file. To do this, you need to scroll down until you find the line that says Language=. This line determines what language the game will use based on a 3-letter code. For example, if Language=DEU, then the game will use German as its language.
 
If you want to change the language to English, you need to set Language=INT. This stands for International English and is the default language for the game. If Language= is set to nothing or an unsupported language, then the game will also use English as its language.
 
After you have changed Language=INT, save the file and close it.
